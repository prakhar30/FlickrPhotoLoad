# Flickr Photo Load

Flickr Photo Load is a simple iOS application created to fetch a few public photos from flickr and display them in a beautiful manner. Tapping each image gives the title and description of the image(subject to availability).

### Tech

The game makes use of the following ideas, implemented in Swift 3, and xCode 8.2 - 
* [URLSession] - To call RESTful API to fetch data from Flickr
* [UITableView] - This table is used to show the user their score card along with their choices against the correct answers.

##### Installation
Simply clone or download the project and open it in xCode 8, Swift 3 to run the application.

Any feedbacks or suggestion for improvements are welcome. :)
